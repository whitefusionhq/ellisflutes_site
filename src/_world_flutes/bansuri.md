### Classical flutes of India

From Wikipedia: ”_The **bansuri** is a transverse flute of India traditionally made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with six or seven finger holes. An ancient musical instrument associated with cowherds and the pastoral tradition, it is intimately linked to the love story of Krishna and Radha and is also depicted in Buddhist paintings from around 100 CE.”_

This new line of wooden bansuri are modern, fusion instruments that offer more robust tone development and freedom from cracking that is often associated with bamboo instruments. These flutes are six hole versions made from a selection of hardwoods with a lip plate made from African Blackwood.  The embouchure is rotated a few degrees toward the player relative to the finger holes, so they are meant to be played right-handed (with the foot of the flute pointing to the right side of the player).  Left-handed versions can be made but they are a custom flute creation and subject to different terms of service.
