### Quena Flutes

The quena (pronounced kay-nah) is a traditional flute of the Andes.  It is in the key of G, has six holes and a thumb hole and plays the diatonic major (do re mi) scale.  It is known for itâ€™s distinct dark timber and strong voice.

The traditional quena designs are often difficult to play in the second octave, requiring a very powerful embouchure, and having a tendency to be slightly flat at the top of the scale.  The design of my new wooden quenas addresses these issues by introducing a taper into the bore to achieve a higher level of optimization.

By tapering the bore, both the intonation and the response of the flute are dramatically improved, and easier access to the second octave is achieved.  So they have the classic quena sound with the added advantage of slightly improved tuning and smoother response.
