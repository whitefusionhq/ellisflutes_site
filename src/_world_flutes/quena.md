### Quena 

The quena (pronounced kay-nah) is a traditional flute of the Andes.  It is typically in the key of G, has six holes and a thumb hole and plays the diatonic major (do re mi) scale.  It is known for it’s distinct timber and strong voice.  The quenacho is of the same design, only a lower key, typically D.

Traditional quena designs are often plagued by issues with tuning accuracy and limited dynamic range.  Meaning that they are difficult to play in the second octave, requiring a very powerful embouchure (and consequently being nearly impossible to play softly), and depending upon the design, having a tendency to be either flat in the second octave, or (in the case of tapered bore quena) sharp in the second octave.  These idiosyncrasies are generally accepted among quena players and compensated for in degree.  

Over the years I have have approached quena making from a more traditional direction, doing both cylindrical bored quena and tapered bore quena, but always attempting a visual aesthetic that is consistent with what players expect quena to look like.  But this adherence to a visual idea also put some limits on the design that prevented some of these tuning issues from being corrected.

Some years back I had an idea for improving the tuning of the quena, but it would require a fundamental change in the appearance of the instrument.  My experiments were very successful, but I did not pursue them because I felt that players would not be interested in something that looked too different.  Therefore I stuck with tradition and made some tapered bore versions that everyone seemed to like.  But I was never really pleased with the compromise.

Recent collaboration with a professional winds player ([Ashley Jarmack](https://www.ashleyjarmack.com), my collaborator on the new kaval line) galvanized me to do what I wanted to do years ago, which was to change the design.  Ashley got hired to do the flute music on a new Netflix series, needing to make a lot of recordings with the quena, but she complained that all of her traditional quena (of which she had many) were not in very good tune and made recording a bit frustrating.  So I offered to let her try one of the new designs, and her enthusiatic response to the prototype that I sent her told me that I was on the right track.

The new quena features a cylindrical bore and very thin walls where the finger holes are located.  This design alteration profoundly affects the tuning balance between the octaves.  I had noticed years ago that the North Indian bansuri, which features very thin walls and large finger holes, had a naturally superior tuning balance compared with most other types of cylindrical bore flutes.  I applied this design feature to the quena with excellent results.

There are challenges to creating such flutes, because manufacturing wooden flutes with extremely thin walls is a delicate business.  Also, I needed to keep the girth of the flute larger at the blowing end in order to have the blowing notch behave like a traditional quena, keeping the classic voice.  In order to create a balanced look I added a "flare" at the distal end of the flute.  The result does not look very much like a traditional quena, but I believe the tuning accuracy is going to be far more important to musicians who need to use a quena in an ensemble setting.


### Quenacho 

The Quencho is just a low quena, usually in the key of D or C.  The same design criteria described above were applied to the Quenacho design as well.  The Quenacho requires greater reach than the quena, and I typically make them with some offset holes for easier ergonomics.  But for players familiar with the piper's grip (a technique used by low whistle players and bagpipe players) it is better to have the holes inline with no offset.

### The Quenxiao

One of my favorite distractions in the workshop is experimenting with fusion instruments.  All of the flutes that I make are based upon traditional folk flutes, even if I give them a more contemporary spin.  But every so often I’ll try something of a mash-up, just to see what happens.  I did this with my East Meets West series of Asian flutes with a Baroque aesthetic.  In that case it is merely a visual fusion—I didn’t actually change the basic character of the instrument itself, I simply made them look interesting and different.  

The fact is that most so-called original ideas in woodwind design are not truly so, because makers have been doing experiments for centuries and there is nothing new under the sun.  And in many cases, even when something seemingly unique has been created, it is rare that the result is actually a flute that brings something new to the table.

However, recently I tried one of my fusion experiments and it yielded a flute that seems quite original, or at the very least something that has not been commercially produced for the flute-playing public.  So I’m going to go ahead and claim that this is something new!  And the thing that sets this apart from other experiments is that this flute is simply one of the coolest things I’ve ever made.

I call it the Quenxiao (kan-sheow) because it is quite literally a fusion of two flutes that I already make--I simply fused the names together.  I combined the Andean quenacho with the Chinese xiao.

The Andean quenacho is just a quena in a lower key (often D or C).  They have a unique voice—very robust, sweet and with a hint of breathiness, like wind in the tall grass.  They ordinarily play a diatonic major scale (do re mi), but in the case of the Quenxiao I gave them the eight-hole scale of the Chinese bei xiao.  They differ from the xiao in having a larger bore and larger finger holes, but the scale is the same.  That is to say that the player has a flute with a well-balanced 2.5 octave range and mind-blowing versatility in terms of the different keys and modes one can play in.

And unlike the traditional xiao, these are much more compact, being 21.5” long instead of 30+”.  So traveling around with them is much easier.

For reasons of accessibility (reach) I am only offering these in the keys of D and C (if you are a xiao player this would translate to G and F).  For a player trying this scale for the first time, I’d recommend the key of D as being the most finger-friendly.
