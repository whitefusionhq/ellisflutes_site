### Bamboo Flutes

> **Already read the Intro/FAQ?** [Jump ahead to the Bamboo store!](#store)

&nbsp;

**Welcome to the new bamboo flute store!** For many years I’ve had an interest in bamboo flutes, but I never pursued the craft of making them.  That changed recently and I have been deeply immersed in learning the art of working with bamboo.

Bamboo is one of the most useful plants on Earth, and it has a millennia long history as being a valued flute-making material in cultures all over the planet.  Crafting high-quality bamboo flutes is a delightful challenge, because each piece is unique and requires the maker to adapt to its organic nature.

I strongly encourage anyone interested in a bamboo flute to read through the entire FAQ section presented here first, and also to read my three-part blog on the subject of bamboo flute craft: [Bamboo Journey](#).

### Bamboo FAQ

**Custom orders:**

Please note that I cannot accept custom order for bamboo flutes.  Because I work alone and already accept orders on all of my standard flute lines, my schedule is pretty full.  I love making bamboo flutes, and I do my best to find time to make small batches of them that I can offer to my customers.  But because I have to do it rather opportunistically, I don’t want the pressure of deadlines or specific expectations around these flutes. I will strive to make a variety available as often as possible, but there is no specific timeline.  For anyone interested in getting a bamboo flute I recommend signing up for my newsletter.  I will do an e-mail announcement each time a new batch is going online, and I will give 24 hours notice before they actually appear in the store.

**Types of bamboo:**

So far I only use three different types of bamboo.  I use black bamboo, as well as very limited amounts of madake, and quite a bit of bambusa multiplex silverstripe.  The silverstripe is used for my transverse flutes because it features a natural taper in the bore which provides superb intonation throughout the scale.

**Types of flutes:**

I make a variety of different types of flutes from bamboo, depending upon what species of bamboo I have available.  I make a basic, transverse bamboo flutes with the diatonic major tuning (very like my Essential Flutes), and I also make a variety of vertical, endblown flutes, including the xiao, shakuhachi, and rim blown flutes.  I also intend to make low whistles at some point if things work out.  More on specific flute types below.

**Cost:**

There are a great many inexpensive bamboo flutes on the market representing varying degrees of quality.  Putting a price on a flute can be a very arbitrary thing, for there are many factors that can affect the cost of any instrument, most notably the cost of materials and the time invested by the maker.

There is a widely held belief that bamboo is an inexpensive flute material.  This is very true, especially if you grow your own.  But while the actual cost of the material might be minimal, the labor involved in utilizing it can be surprising.  There is a process of selection wherein pieces are discarded because they are unsuitable for making high quality flutes, so there is quite a bit of culling.  Then the bamboo must be prepared, which involves removing nodes, smoothing the bore, heat-curing and then drying it, all preliminary to being able to use it, so there is a substantial investment of time before the bamboo is even utilized.  You might be surprised to hear that the time and labor involved in processing bamboo for flute making is actually more than what is required for wood, even when I have to drill/ream the bore of the wooden flute.

For my bamboo flutes, I also take extraordinary steps to ensure that the material is as stable as possible and resistant to cracking.  This sometimes involves vacuum stabilization in a shellac resin bath as well as many finish coats of shellac and natural oils to protect the bamboo from sudden shifts in humidity (which is responsible for cracking many a bamboo flute).   And some species also receive the addition of thread wrapping to give extra stability.  These collective steps all contribute to the time investment that goes into each individual instrument, and this is reflected in the cost of the flute.

**Cracking:**

As most players of bamboo flutes are aware, cracking can be an issue.  As mentioned above, I do everything I can to reduce this risk, but a great deal of the responsibility for preventing this falls to the player.  Sudden changes in temperature and humidity are the problem, and this includes blowing warm air into a cold flute (or in really cold weather), leaving it in a place that is too dry, leaving it in the sun, in freezing temperatures, etc..  Many players with cherished bamboo flutes keep them in a humidor of some type.  I don’t take returns or make replacements of flutes that crack, but I will repair them if possible (and it usually is possible).   If you live someplace that is very hot and dry or very cold and dry, you might have to consider the advisability of buying a bamboo flute at all.  You might do better with one of my wooden instruments.  But generally some common sense flute care will be adequate—just treat them as you would any cherished instrument.

**Tuning:**

As mentioned in my blog on the subject, working with bamboo is different than working with wood because each piece of bamboo is unique.  Because of this, I’ve found the best results when I allow the bamboo itself to dictate what type of flute it will be, what scale I will use, and what tuning I will settle on.  When I speak of tuning, I’m talking about pitches.

Most modern instruments are equal tempered and use A440 as their target pitch.  This is the modern orchestral standard.  Many of the flutes I make adhere to this standard, but some don’t.  Some flutes just don’t want to be that rigid!  Sometimes I will tune to A435, or A432.  This does not mean the flutes will not be “in tune”, because they will always be in proper tune with themselves.  They just might not fit into a modern orchestral setting and may be better suited to solo play.  But each individually listed flute will include this information so you know what you are getting.

**All natural ingredients:**

My bamboo flutes aim to be as natural as possible, meaning that I don’t use synthetic finishes on them.  They are finished with shellac (a natural resin made from the excretions of the lac beetle, which is super cool) and a pure, polymerized linseed oil and pine pitch finish.  This is topped with beeswax paste.  On occasion I do have to use very limited amounts of an adhesive, either an epoxy or cyanoacrylate (super glue).  These adhesives are inert when cured and used only in places where the player will have no contact with them (with the possible exception of a repaired crack).  My binding cord is also made from nylon, since I found that the natural fibers I tried to use were simply not strong enough.

**Unique:**

Each piece of bamboo is different, so that means that every single flute is it’s own thing.  Even two flutes in the same key, same pitch, same scale, etc. will always be different from one another.  This is even true of wooden flutes, but to a lesser degree.  Each bamboo flute will have a unique voice and timbre.  I won’t sell a flute that is not a solid instrument in every sense.

### Shakuhachi Flutes

For all of you shakuhachi purists out there, beware!  First of all, my bamboo shakuhachi are strictly jinashi style.  They have a natural bore, with no manipulation of it’s shape.  They are usually **not** made from madake bamboo (the traditional bamboo they use in Japan).  I only get a few odd pieces of madake, so I tend to use black bamboo or some others from the phyllostachys family.  These make great flutes and they are very beautiful pieces.  So if you are a strict traditionalist, I’d give these a miss.  If you want a lovely, well-tuned and fully functional shakuhachi that you can use for personal meditation, then you might find that these are just the ticket.

### Xiao

Unlike the xiao you can buy from China, these bamboo xiao are all one-piece flutes.  This is a very challenging way to make the xiao, but very rewarding.  Clearing the nodes from the bore of a long, single piece flute is a bit of an art, but I personally like the sound and response of a one-piece xiao.  I’m an avid xiao player myself, so none of these flutes makes it into the store unless it is a flute I would personally play (so the quality has to be very high).  Some pieces don’t have the right bore size for any of the keys I usually make, and those pieces are discarded or used for something else more appropriate.  

### Bamboo Essential Flutes

Like my wooden Essential Flutes, these bamboo versions play the diatonic major scale and are suitable for many types of folk music, including Irish Traditional Music and related styles.  They are made from bamboo that exhibits a natural taper in the bore (similar to my wooden Essential Flutes) and therefore have a naturally superior tuning balance and response.  The lip plates, though sometimes colored, are also made from bamboo.  

### Rim Blown Flutes

This category encompasses all of the vertical, endblown flute styles and tunings that are not either the xiao or shakuhachi.
