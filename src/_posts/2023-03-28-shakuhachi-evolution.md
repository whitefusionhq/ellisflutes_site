title: Shakuhachi Evolution
subtitle: The Complicated Road to Simplicity
---

As many of you know I’ve been making a 1.8 wooden shakuhachi for many years, and I have received gratifyingly positive feedback about this design from players of all skill levels.  And while I’m happy to take credit for the aesthetics of the design, the real secret of success can be chalked up to my having effectively copied a high-quality shakuhachi.  I describe a bit of this process on the shakuhachi page of my website.

Some brief comments on shakuhachi styles taken from that section:

*Traditionally there are two different types of shakuhachi: jinashi and jiari*

*Jinashi means “without paste” and in the context of these modern flutes indicates that the bore is “natural” and is not built up in the way that the jiari style are.*

*Jiari flutes have a bore profile that tapers down and flares out. With traditional, jiari-style bamboo instruments the makers used an urushi paste to shape the bore (hence the paste references) but when the flutes are made from wood this shape is created using special reamers to cut the bore profile.*

*A tapered bore allows for more precise upper octave tuning (which is necessary on flutes made with thick-walled Madake bamboo) and a distinct type of voice. Jiari flutes are more often the choice when playing in ensemble settings but many players choose them for their character.*

This is a very simplified explanation that does not touch on the history and evolution of the shakuhachi.  The scope of this blog doesn’t allow for me to include much back-story about shakuhachi bores or to explain in detail why the modern jiari style came about, since it is complex. But for those who want to learn more I highly recommend Monty Levenson’s splendid work: [Stalking the Wild Bore](https://shakuhachi.com/CM-Levenson-WildBore.html).

So making a really high-quality wooden shakuhachi in the popular jiari style required the manufacture of the aforementioned cutting reamers that would allow me to replicate the tapered bore design that is a feature of this style.  It’s a tricky business and requires a lot of work machining metal to very precise specifications.  Because of this, I only ever created tools to make the 1.8 size shakuhachi (the most popular tuning).  I had quite a few requests over the years to branch out and make other tunings, but I knew that it would be a huge undertaking to manufacture the specific sets of reamers that would be needed for each different key, and I also knew it would just be too much to take on unless I was going to make the shakuhachi my primary focus.

But despite this very practical inner voice that told me not to attempt something so ambitious, I never abandoned my interest in making shakuhachi in different tunings—I simply filed it away for future contemplation. 

Back in the early 2000’s, there was a website maintained by a shakuhachi enthusiast named Nelson Zink.  Sadly it is no longer there, but in one section of his site he had posted a large collection of articles on shakuhachi design where he explored (and explained) the physics behind these fascinating flutes.  In one of the articles he put forth the idea that a very functional shakuhachi could be made from a PVC plastic pipe.  At the time I remember thinking that this was an interesting and elegant solution, but I didn’t know enough about shakuhachi design to have an opinion as to whether or not it was a good idea.  As it happens, early shakuhachi actually *were* simple, cylindrical bore instruments made from a part of the bamboo plant that had thinner walls and fewer organic irregularities in the bore shape.  And even though the shakuhachi evolved, there was plenty of precedent for the “plastic pipe” type of bore.

Fast forward many years to 2022, and I was having an email exchange with shakuhachi teacher and performer [Steven Casano](https://stevencasano.com/about.html).  Steven had bought a couple of my wooden shakuhachi and was very complimentary about them (and he made some very nice recordings and videos with them as well).  He was mentioning how he would be interested in a 2.4 shakuhachi that had a somewhat more robust voice than the more traditional designs that he was accustomed to.  These remarks rang a little bell in my memory and I found myself returning to the Nelson Zink article (luckily, I had saved copies of these articles before his site went offline, so I was able to revisit his thoughts on the PVC shakuhachi).

The virtue of PVC pipe is that it is a simple cylinder with uniform wall thickness and a bore that is also uniformly hard and smooth.  From a woodwind design perspective, this has many advantages.  The down side to working with PVC is that it only comes in standard diameters, and those diameters would only be useful for a couple of very specific tunings.  Also, crafting flutes from PVC isn’t ideal if any sanding is needed, because PVC dust is something you absolutely don’t want to inhale!  A careful maker can avoid the hazards of working with PVC, but on a personal level I didn’t care for the idea of making plastic flutes.  And as I said, the size limits would be a problem.

But creating a simple cylinder with uniform wall thickness and a smooth bore is something that I do every day!  Only I use wood instead of plastic.  And unlike PVC, I can make these cylinders in any size that I choose.  So despite some reservations, I told Steven that I would attempt a 2.4 shakuhachi for him to test. 

What followed was a frenzy of experimental flute making, wherein a couple of dozen prototype flutes were made, all featuring the cylindrical bore.  In the end I made both a 2.4 and a 1.8.  From a maker’s perspective, the cylindrical bore is relatively quick and easy to manage, since I use gun drills to make these precision bores.  But the trick with cylindrical bore flutes is making them in such a way that the octaves are in tune.  Cylindrical flutes have a tendency for the second octave notes to be flat, and over the years I’ve explored design ideas that are intended to overcome this problem.

Well, to make a long story short, I succeeded.  And the design of this flute lent itself to a high degree of production efficiency, which saved me a significant amount of labor.  These are relatively simple flutes in that respect, but they are not so simple when it comes to tone, tuning and response.  They ended up being more “shakuhachi-like” than I had dared to imagine, and I was delighted to find that the streamlined design allowed me to make them much more affordable.  I named this line of instruments the *Simple Zen Shakuhachi* in the hopes of capturing the spirit behind the design.  This is from the shakuhachi page on my website:

*These are cylindrical bore instruments that have been designed in such a way as to provide the response, tuning, and tone color of a shakuhachi without the need for bore manipulation.*

*But to achieve this result, I had to take some liberties with the overall design of the flute, and the most noticeable difference is the thin walls of the instrument. The **Simple Zen Shakuhachi** is very slender in the body compared to a bamboo instrument, and they are lightweight and very comfortable to hold as a result. The utaguchi (mouthpiece) is the same as my jiari instruments, and the finger hole placement and sizing should be quite familiar to players of traditional shakuhachi. By using this thin-walled design I was able to create an instrument that has superb intonation and will allow the player to hit all the notes that would be expected on a well made traditional shakuhachi, with excellent power and responsiveness. But to players familiar with bamboo instruments, these will feel quite different in the hand.*

This slender design is the big difference between the *Simple Zen Shakuhachi* and a traditional bamboo design (as well as my own wooden jiari-style shakuhachi).  This thin-walled approach is the same that I used on my quena flutes in order to optimize octave balance, and it works surprisingly well.  I sent prototypes of these shakuhachi to several professionals, all of whom were pleasantly surprised to find that they sounded quite authentic.  To quote one of the players:

“…I was expecting the cylindrical bore to make a much bigger difference in the sound, but it sounds right. I especially like the brightness I'm able to still get out of it. It feels like there's decent resistance too…If my eyes were closed I'd have no idea it was a different bore. Sounds like a shakuhachi to me!”

Steven Casano also tested them and confirmed that they checked all of the boxes on how a shakuhachi should perform, the only real difference being that they feel a bit different in the hand because of the slender design.

Despite this very positive feedback, it is worth observing that there will be subtle differences between these shakuhachi and the jiari style with the tapered bore.  The tapered bore versions do create a certain level of “resistance” or “back-pressure”.  This is nuanced, but familiar to players of the jiari style.  A cylindrical bore is going to have a bit less of this quality.  On the other hand, the cylindrical bore has a free-blowing quality and also gives a very full voice, which is particularly noticeable on the lower tunings, which (when made in the jiari style) tend to have less volume.   So it’s a good trade in my view.  And I should add that this design makes for a very nice meditation flute as well, being so light in the hand that it’s like playing a tube made of air!

And then there is the cost.

Anyone who has shopped for good quality shakuhachi knows that they can be quite expensive, especially the well-crafted bamboo flutes.  A shakuhachi is considered quite affordable if you can get it for less than a thousand dollars.  Some of the larger shakuhachi cannot be found for less than several thousand dollars.  This means that the less common tunings are out of the reach of many player’s budgets.  

The *Simple Zen Shakuachi* embodies a minimalist sensibility, and because of that I'm able to set the price within a very narrow range.  Basically any flute in the entire range of tunings can be had for as little as $275 or as much as $350, but no more than that.  So if you have always wanted to try a lower shakuhachi (for example a 2.4 or lower) or an unusual or rare tuning (like a 1.7), you don’t have to break the bank.  In fact, for the price of a single, high quality bamboo flute, an enthusiast can own a range of 8-10 different tunings in the *Simple Zen* style.  As of this writing I've finalized the 1.8 and 2.4 tunings, and I'm working on a 2.0 and 1.6.  My intention is to add further tunings as time permits, covering the range from 3.0 up to 1.6, and I might even take a stab at a couple of the higher pitches.

Just listen to Steven Casano playing the 1.8 and 2.4 tunings to get a taste of what these flutes can do.
