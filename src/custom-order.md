**NOTE: As of February 2025 I am suspending custom orders.  I need to catch up on a backlog of existing orders and I need time to restock my online store.  The exception to the custom order suspension is the making of left-handed flutes.  If a player needs a left-handed version, I'm still willing to accept a custom order.  Otherwise I hope to provide a good selection of flutes in my store.

### FAQ


Ordering a flute:

**-Can you declare a lower value on the customs forms so that I don’t have to pay such high import duties?**

While I understand why a buyer would want to reduce their costs, this is basically asking me to break the law.  I know that many makers are willing to declare a value lower than the invoiced price of the instrument, but to falsify the value of a flute on customs forms is postal fraud for the shipper, and for you (the customer) it is tax evasion.  I don’t break the law *so please don’t ask*.

**Can you give me a discount if a buy more than one flute?**

The only substantial discount I offer is if you are a merchant (with either a physical or online store) who wishes to make a wholesale purchase, or if you are a teacher who provides flutes for your students.  But a wholesale purchase requires a substantial minimum order and a demonstration by the buyer that they do in fact operate a resale outlet of some kind.  For a customer buying several flutes at a time, I will often try to minimize the shipping cost to some extent, but otherwise I don’t discount my instruments.

**Can I visit your shop and try out some flutes?**

I don’t have the facilities for hosting visitors, nor do I keep a stock of flutes for auditioning.  I work from home (which is in a very rural area) and it is not practical for me to have customers at my home.

**Can we talk on the phone?**

I only communicate via e-mail these days.  For many years I did have a phone number on my website so that customers could call and place an order.  But as time went on, I was getting more calls and answering more questions (which often lead to other questions) and it got to the point where I was spending many hours per week on the phone.  This began to interfere with my work schedule and I had to stop.  With e-mail, I can answer questions at times that are convenient for me, and in many cases I can provide “canned” answers to frequently asked questions.

**When will you be restocking the online store?**

Because I have to divide my time between various tasks, including fulfilling custom orders, my ability to stock the store is very inconsistent.  In some cases many months can go by before I restock a particular flute.  In cases where a visitor is interested in obtaining a particular flute, I encourage placing a custom order, simply because it is the fastest way to get it.   The wait time for a custom flute varies, but usually it is less than four weeks, whereas waiting for the store to be restocked could go on indefinitely.
