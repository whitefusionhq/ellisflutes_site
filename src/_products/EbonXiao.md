Black Ebonite Xiao, Key of D, tonic G. Making ebonite is as much art as science, and ebonite is very expensive (but worth it!), and the finishing process is much more labor intensive than wood. The extra cost for materials and labor is reflected in the price of these flutes.

New narrow bore xiao design brings a richer harmonic spectrum and improved intonation.  Redesigned mouthpiece with ebonite cap.  To learn more about how the new design came about, check out my blog: [Revisiting the Xiao.](https://www.ellisflutes.com/blog/revisiting-the-xiao)

The xiao is not just for Chinese music (though it excels in that context).  These are fully-realized open-holed flutes with a tremendous range, and are ideal for many forms of music.  You can play in a wide variety of styles with a remarkable tonal range.  A true, Desert Island Flute!  You can learn more about the xiao [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao).

Listen to Connor Keene performing on the new xiao design in the key of D!
