Bamboo (variety of *phyllostachys*) Tang Xiao, Key of B (A440).   Length: 26"   The same 8-hole tuning as the bei xiao, but with the Tang style mouthpiece.  Braided nylon bore bindings.  Minor stabilized surface crack near one finger hole.

*For all flutes, I strongly recommend one of my Flute Care Kits to maintain the finish on your flute. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
