Black bamboo (*phyllostachys nigra*) Basketmaker, Key of G (right-handed),  A432.  Length 33".   Braided nylon bore bindings.  This is one of the larger Basketmaker tunings and requires a greater reach.  If there is any question of being able to reach, please contact me to discuss.

*For all flutes, I strongly recommend one of my Flute Care Kits to maintain the finish on your flute. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
