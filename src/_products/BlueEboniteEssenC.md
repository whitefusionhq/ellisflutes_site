Blue Ebonite, Key of C.  NOTE: This piece of ebonite is obviously not very blue!  The making of ebonite is an organic process and there are often variations in how it presents in the finished product.  Colored ebonite is often a mixture of black ebonite with some colored ebonite.  In this case the black dominated, so the blue is very subdued--so much that it barely shows up in photos.  It still has the amazing resonance that is a feature of ebonite, but I'm not pricing it like I would colored ebonite.  I'm treating it like black ebonite, which is not as costly.  

The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.

The finger hole spacing on the C tuning may not be as comfortable for players with smaller hands, in which case I'd recommend a smaller Essential Flute.

Listen to the amazing Blayne Chastain demonstrate the flute in the sound sample below.

For players unfamiliar with ebonite, I strongly encourage you to read [my blog entry on the subject](http://ellisflutes.com/blog/what-is-ebonite).  It is a truly amazing material for woodwinds of all kinds, and it is all-natural (not plastic or synthetic).  Waterproof, stable and demonstrating superior acoustic properties.

Making ebonite is as much art as science, and colored ebonite is very expensive (but worth it!), and the finishing process is much more labor intensive than wood.  The extra cost for materials and labor is reflected in the price of these flutes.
