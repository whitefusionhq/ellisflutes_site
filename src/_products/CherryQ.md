 Cherry Quena, Key of G.  New design! These quena are the result of many experiments over the years that have resulted in an instrument with superior tuning balance.   Well balanced quena are nearly impossible to find, and I don't believe you will find any quena that can match the intonation of this design.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your wooden flute.  For ebonite flutes, do not use steel wool--only wax and soft cloth.*
