Black bamboo (*phyllostachys nigra*) Key of D/G (A440).  Length 29".   Braided nylon bore bindings.  This xiao had some slight surface cracking along the top during drying, but the cracks have been completely stabilized, though still visible.  

*For all flutes, I strongly recommend one of my Flute Care Kits to maintain the finish on your flute. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
