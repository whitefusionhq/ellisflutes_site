The Selkie™ is designed as a vertical Irish flute, embodying the tonal characteristics and the response of a transverse Irish flute as closely as possible.  Also an excellent choice for whistle players who are interested in playing the flute.   It plays the diatonic major scale (do, re, mi) and has a 2.5 octave range with excellent intonation.  Suitable for all types of music beyond Irish Traditional.  A highly versatile instrument.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*

Blayne Chastain made me a quick "out of the box" test sample of the Selkie.  So this is fairly simple, but you can get a good idea of the tone and range.
