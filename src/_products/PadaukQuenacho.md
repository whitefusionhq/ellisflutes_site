My standard quenacho typically has some offset holes for ergonomics (for players who play with the finger tips).  This quencho is optimized for the piper's grip, so it features inline holes.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
