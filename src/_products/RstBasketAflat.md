Roasted Curly Maple Basketmaker, key of Aflat (right-handed).

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool (not for ebonite flutes) and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.*

Sorry!  The only sound sample at this time is in the key of A and not Aflat.  So you can hear the Basketmaker that is a half-step higher in pitch than this flute.
