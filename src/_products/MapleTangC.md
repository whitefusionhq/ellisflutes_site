The tang xiao has a slightly larger bore and finger holes than the usual bei xiao, but it plays the exact same scale over the same range.  However, the tang mouthpiece is quite different, having a wider and shallower "notch" much more akin to the Japanese Shakuahchi.  This different mouthpiece gives the xiao a different voice and slightly different playing characteristics.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
