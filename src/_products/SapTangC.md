Sapele Tang Xiao, key of C/F (Sapele is a Mahogany-like wood, and is not something I ordinarily stock).   The Tang xiao is a variation on my existing xiao design (the bei xiao).  The Tang version plays the same scale and has the same range, but it uses a different mouthpiece design.  This design gives a broader tonal range and ability to bend notes.  To learn more about this xiao and how it varies from my classic xiao design, you can read more on the xiao page [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao).  You can also watch the video below hear it played and to see a comparison between the Tang and bei xiao designs.

The xiao is not just for Chinese music (though it excels in that context). These are fully-realized open-holed flutes with a tremendous range, and are ideal for many forms of music. You can play in a wide variety of styles with a remarkable tonal range. A true, Desert Island Flute! 

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
