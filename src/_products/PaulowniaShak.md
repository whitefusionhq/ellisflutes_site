Paulownia wood is the lightest wood I've ever used, and is ideal for players  wanting to combat hand fatigue during practice, weighing a mere 163 grams (less than 6oz.).  You'll be surprised by the projection and resonance of this remarkable wood.  But it is also quite soft and will scratch and dent easily, so must be handled very consciously.  This is a tricky wood to work with, and that is reflected in the additional cost.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*

Listen to the incomparable Zac Zinger perfrom the traditional Kinko style honkyoku piece "Takiochi”!  The sound sample is just above the embedded video (they are sort of close together).
