Ellis-Korb headjoint for Boehm flute, Cumberland Ebonite with threaded tenon for precision fit to your silver flute.  Sterling silver bore rings, classic embouchure cut.  Waterproof, beautiful and spectacularly resonant, with superior projection and articulation, specially designed to bring easier access to your third octave notes.

The Ellis-Korb headjoint, in both wood and ebonite, is thin-walled and elegant, and blends well with the natural lines of the flute.  Too many of the wooden headjoints that are available tend to be very clunky (they look a bit like a log attached to the head of the flute!) but the delicate profile of the Ellis-Korb headjoint looks and feels like a natural extension of the Boehm flute.

Headjoint ships with a selection of different sized tenons, all threaded to fit the headjoint.  Player selects the tenon that best fits their flute and returns the extra tenons in a pre-paid shipping container.  Ensures that this headjoint will fit your flute, regardless of make and model.
