Genuine boxwood (*Buxus sempervirens*) one-piece with imitation ivory rings, key of F/Bflat.  Boxwood is a wonderful wood for flutes, but it is very costly (which is reflected in the price).  Finding pieces long enough to make a xiao is not easy!  Part of the new *East Meets West Series* of Baroque-style Asian flutes!  Inspired by the gorgeous decorative style of Baroque flutes and recorders, this is the same great wine in a new bottle (it is the same new xiao design with a different appearance).   This new narrow bore xiao design brings a richer harmonic spectrum and improved intonation.  Redesigned mouthpiece with ebonite cap.  To learn more about how the new design came about, check out my blogs: [Revisiting the Xiao.](https://www.ellisflutes.com/blog/revisiting-the-xiao) and [Keene on the Xiao](https://www.ellisflutes.com/blog/keene-on-the-xiao)

The xiao is not just for Chinese music (though it excels in that context).  These are fully-realized open-holed flutes with a tremendous range, and are ideal for many forms of music.  You can play in a wide variety of styles with a remarkable tonal range.  A true, Desert Island Flute!  You can learn more about the xiao [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao).

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*

Listen to Connor Keene performing on the new xiao design in the key of F!
