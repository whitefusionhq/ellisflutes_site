The new hybrid  *Quimera*™ fuses the robust tone of the Andean quenacho with the hugely versatile 8-hole scale of the Chinese xiao.  Read more about this new creation [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/quimera).   Ergonomic finger hole offset for right-handed player.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
