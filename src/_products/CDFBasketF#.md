For right-handed player. This is the flute that Scott August plays in his amazing piece "Quiet Journey" which you can see below.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*


**PLEASE CONTACT ME BEFORE ORDERING.** *This flute is not covered by my normal return policy*. This is a very large flute and at least half of the players who try it cannot reach the finger holes comfortably. I will provide you detailed information to help you determine if you can play it, but once it is determined that you can reach the flute **I will only consider a return on a case-by-case basis**. I'm sorry to be so strict about this, but this has been a problem in the past and has obliged me to alter my policy. I get a lot of requests for this flute, but be forewarned that it is a stretch, even for tall players.
