Stained Boxwood Xiao, Key of D, tonic G.  Boxwood might easily be called "banana wood" in many cases, due to its historically established tendency to warp like crazy (just take a look at that fourth photo).  If you look at historical photos of wooden flutes from the 18th and 19th century you will see a lot of very bendy woodwinds.  This has no effect upon the voice or playability of the flute.  And in fact, boxwood makes a gorgeous sounding flute.  However, due to the rather unusual shape of these flutes I did not add a subtantial upcharge for the wood (Boxwood is expensive and rare in instrument grade pieces).

The new narrow bore xiao design brings a richer harmonic spectrum and improved intonation.  Redesigned mouthpiece with ebonite cap.  To learn more about how the new design came about, check out my blog: [Revisiting the Xiao.](https://www.ellisflutes.com/blog/revisiting-the-xiao)

The xiao is not just for Chinese music (though it excels in that context).  These are fully-realized open-holed flutes with a tremendous range, and are ideal for many forms of music.  You can play in a wide variety of styles with a remarkable tonal range.  A true, Desert Island Flute!  You can learn more about the xiao [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao).

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute. Not for use on ebonite flutes.*
