Crafted from hard maple and dyed to resemble bamboo, the Simple Zen shakuhachi is a fully realized shakuhachi that can be used for anything from meditation to serious Honkyoku.  An affordable way to enter the world of the shakuhachi.  To learn more about this flute, click [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/shakuhachi).

***Caution: The 2.4 tuning is a very large flute with a substantial reach and larger than average finger holes.  Not recommended for beginners.  If you have never played a shakuhachi of this size and are unsure about your ability to reach this flute, contact me for more details.***

Note: there is minor variation in appearance and color from flute to flute, so your flute may not be an exact match with the pictured flutes, but it will be pretty close.

With all of my wooden flutes I recommend on of my Flute Care Kits for an additional $10, available at checkout.
