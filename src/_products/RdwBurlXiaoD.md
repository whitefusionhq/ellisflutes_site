Rare and beautiful lace redwood burl, resin stabilized and created with a cast bore of epoxy and graphite to give it strength and stability (redwood burl is normally a fragile wood).  Black ebonite bore rings and mouthpiece and nickel silver tenons and tuning slide.  Cast bore flutes make it possible to use unusual and beautiful woods such as burl or curly softwoods that otherwise would not be strong enough.  Lace burl of this quality is uncommon.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes*
