The Essential Flute plays the diatonic major scale (do, re, mi) and has a 2.5 octave range with excellent intonation.  Suitable for all types of music, including Irish Traditional.  Ergonomically set up for a right-handed player (holding the foot of the flute toward your right).  A highly versatile instrument.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
