 Curly Maple (stained) key of Bflat/Eflat.  This xiao is lower than average, and the reach is slightly greater than the mid-range tunings.  Piper's grip is required for most players. This new narrow bore xiao design brings a richer harmonic spectrum and improved intonation.  Redesigned mouthpiece with ebonite cap.  To learn more about how the new design came about, check out my blogs: [Revisiting the Xiao.](https://www.ellisflutes.com/blog/revisiting-the-xiao) and [Keene on the Xiao](https://www.ellisflutes.com/blog/keene-on-the-xiao)

The xiao is not just for Chinese music (though it excels in that context).  These are fully-realized open-holed flutes with a tremendous range, and are ideal for many forms of music.  You can play in a wide variety of styles with a remarkable tonal range.  A true, Desert Island Flute!  You can learn more about the xiao [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao).

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*

Listen to Connor Keene demonstrating the Bflat in this video at the 3:21 mark.
