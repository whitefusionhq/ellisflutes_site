Classic Black Ebonite "Irish" flute in the key of D (diatonic major tuning), featuring nickel silver tuning slide and bore rings, and a two-piece middle section for improved ergonomics.  Partially lined headjoint and corked joints.  Comes with padded flannel flute roll, cork grease and wax.  Powerful, lively tone and response.  Perfect for a session down at your local pub!

For players unfamiliar with ebonite, I strongly encourage you to read [my blog entry on the subject](http://ellisflutes.com/blog/what-is-ebonite).  It is a truly amazing material for woodwinds of all kinds, and it is all-natural (not plastic or synthetic).  Waterproof, stable and demonstrating superior acoustic properties.  NOTE: ebonite does have a mild smell of rubber when it is warm, and some players don't care for it.  It seems to fade over time, and personally I don't even notice it.  However, it should be mentioned if you have a particularly sensitive nose.

Making ebonite is as much art as science, and colored ebonite is very expensive (but worth it!), and the finishing process is much more labor intensive than wood.  The extra cost for materials and labor is reflected in the price of these flutes.
