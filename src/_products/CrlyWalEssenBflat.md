Beautiful and highly figured black walnut.  The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.  NOTE:  The Bflat tuning is the largest Essential Flute that I make, and additional ergonomic treatment of the holes is provided to make for an easier reach.  Be advised that this flute has larger finger holes and a substantial reach.  If you have smaller hands, or any sort of issues stemming from physical challenges, then this might not be the flute for you.  Piper's grip recommended.  

The newest version of the Essential Flute features additional enhancements for improved performance and continuity of tone.  You can read about it [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/transverse-folk). 

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool (not for ebonite flutes) and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  *

Watch Blayne Chastain of The Irish Flute Store giving a demonstration of all of the Essential Flutes.
