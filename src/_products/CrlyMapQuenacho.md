Luthier grade curly maple (stained) Quenacho, Key of D w/ergonomic finger hole layout for comfort (right hand on lower holes).  For players with smaller hands or limited reach, these might be a bit much.  You can effectively play with piper’s grip, which helps a lot.

The quenacho is a six hole flute (there is a small thumb hole that acts as a register hole, but it does not play a note) tuned to the diatonic major scale, just like the quena.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your wooden flute. For ebonite flutes, do not use steel wool--only wax and soft cloth.*

Listen to Ashley Jarmack performing on one of these new quenacho in the video below.
