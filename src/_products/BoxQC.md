Be advised that as with the xiao, the Quimera in the key of C requires a bit more reach and for most players it is necessary to use the traditional xiao grip to hold the flute comfortably. This is also called the "*piper's grip*".  I recommend this technique for all xiao and Quimera, but your mileage may vary.  

Castelo Boxwood is different from the true European Boxwood (*Buxus sempervirens*), but it gets its name from the amazing similarity between the woods.  Fine-grained with a buttery texture and color, it is a personal favorite of mine for flute crafting.  The new hybrid  *Quimera*™ fuses the robust tone of the Andean quenacho with the hugely versatile 8-hole scale of the Chinese xiao.  Read more about this new creation [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/quimera).   Ergonomic finger hole offset for right-handed player.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
