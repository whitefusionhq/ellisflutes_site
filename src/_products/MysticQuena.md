New design! These quena are the result of many experiments over the years that have resulted in an instrument with superior tuning balance.   Well balanced quena are nearly impossible to find, and I don't believe you will find any quena that can match the intonation of this design.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
