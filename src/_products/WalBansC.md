Beautiful piece of Curly Black Walnut!  Key of C (tonic F).  **This is a large flute** and I would not recommend it for beginners.  Flutes of this size require the player to use the traditional bansuri grip (often called the piper's grip), and even then it is on the large size for many players.  If you are an experienced player who is familiar with the various different sized bansuri, then you know what you are getting into :-)  Flute length is approximately 28" (70cm).

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*
