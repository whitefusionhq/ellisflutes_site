Transverse flute, key of E  (A442) with bamboo lip plate and diatonic major (do re mi) tuning.  Length:  20"   Suitable for all types of folk music including Irish traditional.  Made from *Bambusa Multiplex Silverstripe*, a robust variety of bamboo with a natural taper in the bore which provides excellent intonation.  **NOTE:** These flutes are ergonomically set up for right-handed players (meaning players who play with the foot of the flute pointing to the right).  The embouchure hole is rotated six degrees toward the player, a common position chosen by most transverse flute players.  

*For all flutes, I strongly recommend one of my Flute Care Kits to maintain the finish on your flute. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*
