An unusual offering, this is a seven hole flute (has a thumb hole) playing the Megan Avot scale in the key of C.  Ergonomic fingering for right-handed player.  The finger hole spacing on these are a bit unusual (see photos) so you might have to use the little finger of your right hand.  I don't have a sound sample, but I'm embedding a video of Paul Kara Ross demonstrating one of these flutes on YouTube.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool (not for ebonite flutes) and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  *
