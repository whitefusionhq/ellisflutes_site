I’m pleased to offer the new Compact Xiao!  I wanted to make a xiao that was more convenient to carry as well as being easier to manufacture, thus allowing me to offer a fully functional xiao at a more affordable price.  To understand how the Compact xiao differs from my traditional full-length xiao, visit the xiao page of this website: https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao

The xiao is not just for Chinese music (though it excels in that context).  These are fully-realized open-holed flutes with a tremendous range, and are ideal for many forms of music.  You can play in a wide variety of styles with a remarkable tonal range.  A true, Desert Island Flute!  You can learn more about the xiao [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/xiao).

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*

Thanks to Connor Keene for sound sample!
