Pacific Quilted Maple rim blown flute, Magen Avot scale, Key of C with golden-brown stain.  This is a seven hole flute, and the lowest note is typically played using the little finger of the right hand to accommodate the reach.

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your wooden flute.  For ebonite flutes, do not use steel wool--only wax and soft cloth.*

Sound sample pending!  However, one of my customers kindly gave permission for me to link to his YouTube video of him playing his new Magen Avot flute, and it gives a nice sense of the scale and the potential of the flute.
