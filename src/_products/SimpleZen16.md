Crafted from hard maple and dyed to resemble bamboo, the Simple Zen shakuhachi is a fully realized shakuhachi that can be used for anything from meditation to serious Honkyoku.  An affordable way to enter the world of the shakuhachi.  To learn more about this flute, click [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/shakuhachi).

Note: there is minor variation in appearance and color from flute to flute, so your flute may not be an exact match with the pictured flutes, but it will be pretty close.

With all of my wooden flutes I recommend on of my Flute Care Kits for an additional $10, available at checkout.
