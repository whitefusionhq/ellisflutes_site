Densly figured Curly Maple, Key of F.  The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.  The newest version of the Essential Flute features additional enhancements for improved performance and continuity of tone.  You can read about it [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/transverse-folk). 

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool (not for ebonite flutes) and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  *
