Curly Maple (stained), 1.8 Key of D.  Part of the new *East Meets West Series* of Baroque-style Asian flutes!  Inspired by the gorgeous decorative style of Baroque flutes and recorders, this is the same great wine in a new bottle (it is the same shakuhachi design with a different appearance).   

*For all flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits. They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu).*

Listen to the incomparable Zac Zinger perfrom the traditional Kinko style honkyoku piece "Takiochi”!
