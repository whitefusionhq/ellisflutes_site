**Buying a bamboo flute**

-As mentioned in the FAQ section, I don’t take custom orders for bamboo flutes.  This means that what you see here is what is available.  I  will update this stock as often as possible, and I will always give 24 hours notice before putting new flutes up for sale.  If you subscribe to my newsletter you will be told when this is happening.

-Each flute is unique.  There are natural discolorations, variations in shape, etc..  Some flutes will have cosmetic flaws or minor repairs to these flaws, including some surface cracking (in rare cases).  In all instances, the cosmetic repairs have been rendered as invisible as possible and any surface cracking has been stabilized.

Each flute sounds and plays slightly differently.  I take pains to make sure the voice and tuning is of the highest quality, but some of the subjective qualities, such as timbre and what might be called the “feel” of the flute are not quantifiable, so I don’t make any attempt to describe the character of the individual flutes, nor can I provide sound samples for individual flutes.  And in truth, recorded sound samples tell you much more about the player than the flute!  Microphones simply don’t capture the experience of the flute—they really only let you hear the pitch.

-In each listing I will designate the approximate foundational tuning of each flute (i.e. A=440, A=435, A=442, etc.).  I say approximate because embouchure flutes have flexible pitch, so A=target pitch when the flute is warmed up with an ambient temperature of about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  Each flute will be in tune with itself based upon that foundational frequency.

-I will include information on the length of each flute (some of them are quite long).  If the flute has a challenging reach, I will include a caution.
