The online store is always being updated with the latest flutes that are in stock. If you don't find what you are looking for (or if the store is low on stock) contact me to place a custom order.

Please note that I generally do not do custom tunings or custom artwork outside of my standard designs. In the case of exceptions, all custom flutes are considered non-returnable items.

### Return Policy

I have a 7 day return policy for all of my standard flutes. Customer has 7 days from the day of receiving the flute to make sure they are satisfied with it an wish to keep it. I will accept a return if contacted within that period (and I ask that the customer contact me **prior** to sending the flute back--don't just pop it in the mail without telling me first) and will issue a refund, minus a 5% restocking fee.  This fee also applies to canceled orders (those where payment has already been processed but which the flute has not been shipped).  In the case of a cancelled order the fee is only 3%.   This is due in part to new policies from merchant services regarding processing fees.  These online services (such as PayPal and Stripe) *will not refund the processing fees incurred*.  So returns and cancelled orders are refunded minus shipping charges, processing fees and a small restocking charge.  I wish this were different, but....

**Flute must be returned in brand new condition** at buyers expense. Insurance is recommended for return shipping *since the customer is responsible for the flute until I receive it back*.   I strongly advise that the flute be packed in it's original packing materials if they are still intact, especially the reinforced cardboard tube in the package that protects the flute.  Beyond that 7 day period all sales are final.
