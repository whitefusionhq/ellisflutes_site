The online store is always being updated with the latest flutes that are in stock. If you don't find what you are looking for (or if the store is low on stock) contact me to place a custom order.  The exception to this are bamboo flutes--I don't take custom orders for those.

Please note that I generally do not do custom tunings or custom artwork outside of my standard designs. In the case of exceptions, all custom flutes are considered non-returnable items.

### Return/Exchange Policy

I evaluate any return/exchange on a case-by-case basis.  Customer has 7 days from the day of receiving the flute to contact me to discuss a possible return or exchange.  I require that the customer contact me **prior** to sending the flute back.  If I accept the return, I will issue a refund, minus a 15%  restocking fee.  Canceled orders (those where payment has already been processed but the flute has not been shipped) are refunded minus a 3-5% fee.   This is due to new policies from merchant services regarding processing fees.  These online services (such as PayPal and Stripe) *will not refund the processing fees incurred*, even if the order is not fulfilled.  Once you have made the purchase, the merchant services have their fee and won't give it back, and it's about 3-5% these days for all of them.   

**Flute must be returned in brand new condition** at buyers expense. Insurance is recommended for return shipping *since the customer is responsible for the flute until I receive it back*.   I strongly advise that the flute be packed in its original packing materials if they are still intact, especially the reinforced cardboard tube in the package that protects the flute.
