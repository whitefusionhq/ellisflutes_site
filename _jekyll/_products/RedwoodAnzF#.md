Redwood rim-blown flute, Key of F# (pentatonic major scale).  This is the same flute as the Basketmaker, only without a thumb hole (which is very tricky on a flute this big).  This is the flute that Scott August plays in his amazing piece "Quiet Journey" which you can see below.

PLEASE CONTACT ME BEFORE ORDERING.  This is a very large flute and at least half of the players who try it cannot reach the finger holes comfortably.  I can provide you some information to help you determine if you can play it.
