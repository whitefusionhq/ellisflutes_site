Stunning and rare Curly Douglas Fir Shakuhachi, 1.8 Key of D.   NOTE: On some pieces of Curly Douglas Fir, the dense figure creates fissures in the wood that are sometimes visible in places on the finished instrument (as a result of the dye showing them up).  This does not weaken or compromise the flute--the wood has been through a vacuum resin infusion process and any visible fissures have been completely stabilized. Weight: 320 grams

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*

Listen to the incomparable Zac Zinger perfrom the traditional Kinko style honkyoku piece "Takiochi”!
