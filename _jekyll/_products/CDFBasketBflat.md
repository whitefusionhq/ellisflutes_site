Visually stunning Curly Douglas Fir Basketmaker, dyed a golden brown to accent grain. Key of Bflat for right-handed player. This is a very rare wood and the last time I saw any was in 2007. I recently acquired a very few boards of this beautiful wood and will be using it for some select flutes while supplies last. When it's gone, it's gone! 

Sorry, the only sound sample available is in the key of A below.  This will give you a close idea of the sound and range of the flute, if not the exact pitch.
