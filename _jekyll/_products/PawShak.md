Paulownia wood shakuhachi.  This extraordinary wood is the lightest flute making wood I've ever encountered.  Sought after for making wooden boats due to it's strength and low density, it will blow your mind!  It's like playing a tube made from air.  For any players who have issues with arthritis or just simply practice fatigue--this flute weighs next to nothing and has a huge sound.  Normally a nearly white colored wood, it has been stained a rich, handsome brown.  NOTE:  This wood is quite soft, and it will absolutely get dented over time.  This is cosmetic and probably inevitable if you handle the flute routinely, but it's worth the trade off if you want a super light-weight flute with great resonance!  You really feel it in your fingertips, and the flute has a powerful voice.
