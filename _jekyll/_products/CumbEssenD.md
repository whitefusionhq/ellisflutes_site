Cumberland Ebonite, Key of D.  The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.  The newest version of the Essential Flute features additional enhancements for improved performance and continuity of tone.  You can read about it [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/transverse-folk). 

For players unfamiliar with ebonite, I strongly encourage you to read [my blog entry on the subject](http://ellisflutes.com/blog/what-is-ebonite).  It is a truly amazing material for woodwinds of all kinds, and it is all-natural (not plastic or synthetic).  Waterproof, stable and demonstrating superior acoustic properties.

Making ebonite is as much art as science, and colored ebonite is very expensive (but worth it!), and the finishing process is much more labor intensive than wood.  The extra cost for materials and labor is reflected in the price of these flutes.
