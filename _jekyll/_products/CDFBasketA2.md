Visually stunning Curly Douglas Fir Basketmaker, dyed a golden brown to accent grain.  Key of A.   This is a very rare wood and the last time I saw any was in 2007.  I recently acquired a very few boards of this beautiful wood and will be using it for some select flutes while supplies last.  When it's gone, it's gone!
