Amazing curly maple, dyed with my special "Mystic Blue" blend of dyes. Key of B (tonic E).

CAUTION: This flute is not recommended for beginners. This bansuri is very large and covering the finger holes can be a challenge for inexperienced players or those of smaller stature. If you are looking for a first bansuri, I highly recommend starting with key of D (tonic G) instead.
