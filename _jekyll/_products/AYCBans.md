Alaskan Yellow Cedar Bansuri, key of D (tonic G) with African Blackwood lip plate. 

*The African blackwood lip plate on these flutes is a rosewood and therefore falls under the CITIES index. Future bansuri will be made with polished black ebonite (natural hard rubber) lip plates.

*There have been many recent changes in the CITIES regulations. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) regulates trade for certain species through a system of permits between custom inspections at both ends of the supply chain. This provides extra measures to ensure that various species are protected so that international trade does not threaten their survival. Most species of Rosewood have been added to the CITIES appendix. Not all of them are endangered or even seriously threatened, but many are facing potential over-harvesting that might ultimately endanger them, so their trade is being restricted. As a result, even artisans like myself who have stockpiles of flute woods that were acquired pre-CITIES now require special permits to ship instruments made from these woods outside of the U.S. These permits are costly and cumbersome, and having them does not guarantee that the international customer will not have to negotiate certain complications on their end when it comes to receiving such woods. Therefore I am limiting sale of all rosewoods to customers within the U.S. who face no restrictions and require no permits to purchase. I have very limited stockpiles of rosewood species and I do not intend to acquire any more, even though the permit process does still allow commercial trade in these woods.
