Gorgeous bansuri from a piece of highly figured black walnut.  African blackwood lip plate.  Key of E (tonic A).

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*

Listen below to the amazing Joshua Geisler demonstrating the E/A bansuri.
