Cherry Basketmaker flute, Key of Bflat for right-handed player.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*

Sorry--the sound sample is in the key of A!  At this time we only have a demonstration of the 7-hole basketmaker in this key, but it will give you an idea of the range of the instrument.  Key of Bflat is only a half-step higher in pitch.
