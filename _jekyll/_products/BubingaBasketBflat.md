Bubinga Basketmaker, Key of Bflat (right-handed).

Sorry, the only sound sample available is in the key of A below.  This will give you a close idea of the sound and range of the flute, if not the exact pitch.

Dut to the CITIES restrictions on certain types of woods, this flute can only be shipped within the U.S.
