Stunning Curly Douglas Fir Shakuhachi, 1.8 Key of D.  The Curly Fir has been stabilized and dyed to bring out the beautiful grain pattern.  Because of the highly figured nature of the wood, the Curly Fir is prone to visible "fissures" in the wood that are sometimes accented due to the dye.  *These visible fissures are fully stabilized and are not active cracks in the wood.*

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*
