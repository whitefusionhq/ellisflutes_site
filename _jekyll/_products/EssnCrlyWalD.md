Gorgeous Curly Black Walnut Essential Flute in D.  The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.

The finger hole spacing on the D tuning may not be as comfortable for players with smaller hands, in which case I'd recommend the key of Eflat or F.

Listen to the amazing Blayne Chastain demonstrate the flute in the sound sample below.
