Lovely golden brown curly roasted maple Basketmaker flute!  Key of Bflat (right-handed).  The maple is actually oven roasted until it carmelizes and changes color naturally.

Sorry, the only sound sample available is in the key of A below.  This will give you a close idea of the sound and range of the flute, if not the exact pitch.
