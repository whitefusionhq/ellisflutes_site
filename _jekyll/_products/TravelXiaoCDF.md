The new compact travel xiao is a one-piece, shortened version of the classic xiao. I simplified this design to make this a more practical option for players who want to experience the xiao and who like the ability to conveniently travel with their flutes.  The shortened version was achieved by eliminating the extra length and the tone hole matrix that is a feature of the classic bei xiao. The tone hole matrix on the full length xiao adds stability to the root note and enhances higher harmonics. To compensate for their absence, the bore is back-reamed at the foot to enhance the stability of the root.

Listen below to Scott August demonstrating a xiao in D.
