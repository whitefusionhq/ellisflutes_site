Black Walnut compact xiao, Key of C (tonic F).

The new compact travel xiao is a one-piece, shortened version of the classic xiao. I simplified this design to make this a more practical option for players who want to experience the xiao and who like the ability to conveniently travel with their flutes.  The shortened version was achieved by eliminating the extra length and the tone hole matrix that is a feature of the classic bei xiao. The tone hole matrix on the full length xiao adds stability to the root note and enhances higher harmonics. To compensate for their absence, the bore is back-reamed at the foot to enhance the stability of the root.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*
