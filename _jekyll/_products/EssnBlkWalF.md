Essential Flute in Black Walnut, Key of F.   The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.

This is the smallest Essential Flute that I make so far, and it's very finger friendly.
