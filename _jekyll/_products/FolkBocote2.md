This new version of the transverse folk flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.

The finger hole spacing on the D tuning may not be as comfortable for players with smaller hands, in which case I'd recommend the key of Eflat.

Listen to the amazing Blayne Chastain demonstrate the flute in the sound sample below.
