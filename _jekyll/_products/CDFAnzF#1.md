Stunning and rare Curly Douglas Fir rim-blown flute, Key of F# (pentatonic major scale).  This is the same flute as the Basketmaker, only without a thumb hole (which is very tricky on a flute this big).  This is the flute that Scott August plays in his amazing piece "Quiet Journey" which you can see below.

**PLEASE CONTACT ME BEFORE ORDERING.**  *This flute is not covered by my normal return policy*. This is a very large flute and at least half of the players who try it cannot reach the finger holes comfortably.  I will provide you detailed information to help you determine if you can play it, but once it is determined that you can reach the flute **I will only consider a return on a case-by-case basis**.  I'm sorry to be so strict about this, but this has been a problem in the past and has obliged me to alter my policy.  I get a lot of requests for this flute, but be forewarned that it is a stretch, even for tall players.
