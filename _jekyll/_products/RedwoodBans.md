Salvaged Old Growth Redwood,  featuring an African blackwood lip plate.  Key of B, tonic E.   *Redwood is a very soft and lightweight wood!  It is wonderfully resonant to play, but it is not as robust as a hardwood, so handle appropriately.*

NOTE: This is the largest bansuri that I make, and for those who are familiar with this tuning you will know that these require quite a reach.  Not recommended for beginners or players with smaller hands.  If you have any doubts about the reach, contact me to discuss before purchase.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*
