Beautiful Curly Black Walnut Essential Flute in the key of D.  The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection.   The newest version of the Essential Flute features additional enhancements for improved performance and continuity of tone.  You can read about it [HERE](https://www.ellisflutes.com/world-flutes/transverse-folk).   This is a new tunable option that is now available on all Essential Flutes.  The tuning slide allows pitch adjustments to make ensemble playing easier.

The finger hole spacing on the D tuning may not be as comfortable for players with smaller hands, in which case I'd recommend the key of Eflat or F.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes*
