Essential Flute in beautiful black walnut, key of C.   The Essential Flute is ideal for both Celtic music and World music of all kinds. Diatonic major tuning. Featuring a tapered head bore for improved intonation and projection. Ergonomic embouchure hole placement for right-handed player.

The finger hole spacing on the C tuning is may not be suitable for players with smaller hands.  In which case I'd recommend the keys of D, Eflat or F.
