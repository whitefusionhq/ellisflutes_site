Visually stunning Curly Douglas Fir xiao, dyed a golden brown to accent grain. Key of D (tonic G). This is a very rare wood and the last time I saw any was in 2007. I recently acquired a very few boards of this beautiful wood and will be using it for some select flutes while supplies last. When it's gone, it's gone!

Listen to Scott August demonstrating the xiao in D below.
