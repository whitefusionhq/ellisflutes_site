Granadillo (Platymiscium pinnatum), key of Aflat for right-handed player.

The new Ellis/August Basketmaker 2.0 flute is a seven hole rim blown flute that emphasizes the major pentatonic scale. The addition of the thumb hole provides extended range and easier transition between the first and second octave. It also can effect how the player holds the flute, so we recommend choosing a higher key than you might normally play to guarantee a reasonably comfortable grip.

Sorry no sound sample for this tuning.
