Curly Maple (dyed) with African Blackwood lip plate.

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes*

Listen below to the incomparable Joshua Geisler demonstrate a raga on an Ellis bansuri in E.

The African blackwood lip plate on these flutes is a rosewood and therefore falls under the CITIES index. Future bansuri will be made with polished black ebonite (natural hard rubber) lip plates.
