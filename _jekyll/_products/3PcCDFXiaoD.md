Curly Douglas Fir sectional xiao, Key of D (tonic G).  Featuring a nickel silver tuning slide and Delrin mouthpiece and reinforcing bore rings at the joints.This is a very rare wood and the last time I saw any was in 2007.  I recently acquired a very few boards of this beautiful wood and will be using it for some select flutes while supplies last.  When it's gone, it's gone! 

Listen below to Scott August demonstrating a xiao in D.
