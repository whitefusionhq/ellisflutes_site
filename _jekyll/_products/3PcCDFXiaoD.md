Curly Douglas Fir sectional xiao, Key of D (tonic G).  Featuring a nickel silver tuning slide and Delrin mouthpiece and reinforcing bore rings at the joints.This is a very rare wood and the last time I saw any was in 2007.  I recently acquired a very few boards of this beautiful wood and will be using it for some select flutes while supplies last.  When it's gone, it's gone! 

*For all wooden flutes, I recommend one of my Flute Care Kits.  They are only available as an add-on purchase at the time of checkout (after you have pressed the “Add to cart” button you will see the option for the care kit right along side and you have to select it from the menu). The care kit includes the recommended wax, fine steel wool and instructions for maintaining the finish on your flute.  Not for use on ebonite flutes.*
