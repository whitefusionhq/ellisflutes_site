Glorious green ebonite shakuhachi!  1.8, Key of D. Weight: 450grams (16 oz.).   For players unfamiliar with ebonite, I strongly encourage you to read [my blog entry on the subject](http://ellisflutes.com/blog/what-is-ebonite).  It is a truly amazing material for woodwinds of all kinds, and it is all-natural (not plastic or synthetic).  Waterproof, stable and demonstrating superior acoustic properties.

Making ebonite is as much art as science, and colored ebonite is very expensive (but worth it!), and the finishing process is much more labor intensive than wood.  The extra cost for materials and labor is reflected in the price of these flutes.

Listen to the incomparable Zac Zinger perfrom the traditional Kinko style honkyoku piece "Takiochi”!
