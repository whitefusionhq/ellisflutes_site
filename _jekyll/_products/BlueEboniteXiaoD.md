A feast for the eyes and ears!  Gorgeous Blue ebonite xiao in the key of D (tonic G), featuring nickel silver tuning slide and tenons.

For players unfamiliar with ebonite, I strongly encourage you to read [my blog entry on the subject](http://ellisflutes.com/blog/what-is-ebonite).  It is a truly amazing material for woodwinds of all kinds, and it is all-natural (not plastic or synthetic).  Waterproof, stable and demonstrating superior acoustic properties.

Making ebonite is as much art as science, and colored ebonite is very expensive (but worth it!), and the finishing process is much more labor intensive than wood.  The extra cost for materials and labor is reflected in the price of these flutes.

Listen below to Scott August demonstrating a xiao in D.
