The online store is always being updated with the latest flutes that are in stock. If you don't find what you are looking for (or if the store is low on stock) contact me to place a custom order.

Please note that I generally do not do custom tunings or custom artwork outside of my standard designs. In the case of exceptions, all custom flutes are considered non-returnable items.

### Return Policy

I have a 7 day return policy for all of my standard flutes. Customer has 7 days from the day of receiving the flute to make sure they are satisfied with it an wish to keep it. I will accept a return if contacted within that period and will issue a refund minus a 15% restocking fee upon receipt of the returned flute. Flute must be returned in brand new condition at buyers expense. Insurance is recommended for return shipping since customer is responsible for the flute until I receive it back. Beyond that 7 day period all sales are final.
