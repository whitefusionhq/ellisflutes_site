### Artisan Craftsmanship

Yeah that *happened* very slowly and kind of organically. Initially when I had made a handful of them that I thought were pretty good. I remember taking a trip back up to Portland. My wife was still a student at the time up in Portland so I used to go up regularly to visit her and I remember going into some of the music stores in Portland. Basically walking off the streets saying "hey I've got these flutes I make. you want to buy them?" and miraculously a couple of music stores actually did and bought them with some regularity.
