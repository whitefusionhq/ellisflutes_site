### About the Maker
{:class='text-center'}

Geoffrey Ellis has been a respected maker of world ethnic flutes since 1998. He got his professional start selling Native American flutes to local music shops in _Portland, Oregon_. Since relocating to the redwoods of _Humboldt County in Northern California_, Geoffrey found great success selling directly over the internet to flute enthusiasts around the world. His collaborations with top flautists such as _Ron Korb, Peter Phippen, and Joshua Geisler_ have resulted in an exquisite portfolio of flute lines for the discerning musician.
